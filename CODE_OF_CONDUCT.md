# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of background or experience.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (repository, issues, pull requests, discussions) and to anyone interacting with the project and its community.

## Our standards

### Expected behaviour
- Be respectful, inclusive, and considerate.
- Assume good intent; seek to understand before rushing to judgement.
- Offer constructive feedback; critique ideas, not people.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.

### Unacceptable behaviour
- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary jokes and language.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission.
- Sustained or wilful disruption of discussions.
- Any behaviour that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings, temporary or permanent bans, or removal of contributions that violate this Code.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and when an individual is officially representing the project or its community.

## Attribution
